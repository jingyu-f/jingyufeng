The new international prize of €100,000 (£86,000) – making it one of the world's richest architecture prizes – is given by the Henrik Frode Obel Foundation to a project completed in the last five years that offers "seminal solutions to urgent problems".

The water garden, which is attached to artist's retreat Art Biotop, is formed of 318 trees planted around 160 small ponds.

At the same time, this investigation is closely concerned with questions about the nature of metaphor. Comparisons are made between a central metaphorical structure in the Zhuangzi on the one hand and contemporary views of the nature of metaphor by Donald Davidson and by Lakoff and Johnson on the other. It is hoped that these comparisons will help to illuminate the central metaphorical structure and its role in the philosophy of the Zhuangzi.<br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236705738_Zhuangzi_and_the_Nature_of_Metaphor" id="link_zhuangzi">link</a></div>

   <div id="mushroom" class="reveal">The Mushroom at the End of the World: On the Possibility of Life in <button id="button_capitalist" onclick="Button(2)">Capitalist</button> Ruins <br>Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing<br><br>This book takes up the story of precarious livelihoods and precarious environments through tracking matsutake commerce and ecology. In each case, I find myself surrounded by patchiness, that is, a mosaic of open-ended assemblages of entangled ways of life, with each further opening into a mosaic of temporal rhythms and spatial arcs. I argue that only an appreciation of current precarity as an earthwide condition allows us to notice this—the situation of our world. As long as authoritative analysis requires assumptions of <button id="button_growth">growth</button>, experts don’t see the heterogeneity of space and time, even where it is obvious to ordinary participants and observers. Yet theories of heterogeneity are still in their infancy. To appreciate the patchy unpredictability associated with our current condition, we need to reopen our imaginations. The point of this book is to help that process along—with mushrooms.</div><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World.html?id=tLlKCAAAQBAJ" id="link_mushroom" target="_blank">link</a>
