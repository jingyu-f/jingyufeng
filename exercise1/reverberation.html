    <p style="display: inline;font-size:50px;">; nothing friendly that might warm ('I'm cold, let's go back to Paris). Anxiety mounts; I observe its progress, like Socrates chatting (as I am reading) and feeling the <a href="cold.html" style="color: grey;">cold</a></p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size:50px;">of the hemlock rising</p><p style="display: inline;font-size:40px;"> of resentment and of oblation. Yet I can emerge from this tunnel; I can “surmount,” without liquidating; what I have affirmed a first time, I can once again affirm, without repeating it, for then what I affirm is the affirmation, not its contingency: I affirm </p><p style="display: inline;font-size:30px;">the affirmation, I begin again, without repeating, {The encounter is radiant; later on, in memory</p>, <p style="display: inline;font-size:25px;">and death rises up and sweeps me away: this is the kingdom of memory, weapon of reverberation </p><p style="display: inline;font-size:20px;">is the body—that imaginary body, so “coherent” (coalescent) that I can experience it only in the form of a generalized pang. This pang (analogous to a blush which reddens the face, with shame or emotion) is a sudden panic. In the usual kind of panic—the stage fright which precedes some sort of performance -- I see myself in the future in a condition of failure, imposture, scandal. In amorous panic, I am afraid of my own destruction, which I suddenly glimpse, inevitable, clearly formed, in the flash of a word, an image.</p> <p style="display: inline;font-size:25px;">— of what Nietzsche called ressentiment.</p><p style="display: inline;font-size:30px;">the subject will telescope into one the three moments of the amorous trajectory; he will speak of “love’s dazzling tunnel.”)</p>
<p style="display: inline;font-size:40px;"> the first encounter in its difference, I desire its return, not its repetition.</p>

    <p style="display: inline;font-size:60px;">is to be surprised. The lover is constantly so; he has no time to transform, to reverse, to protect. Perhaps he knows his stupidity, but he does not censure it. Or again: his stupidity acts as a cleavage, a perversion: <i>it's stupid, he says, and yet . . . it’s true.</i>)</p>
