    <p style="display: inline;font-size:60px;">(What is <a href="stupid.html">stupid</a> is to be surprised. The lover is constantly so; he has no time to transform, to reverse, to protect. Perhaps he knows his stupidity, but he does not censure it. Or again: his stupidity acts as a cleavage, a perversion: <i>it's stupid, he says, and yet . . . itâ€™s true.</i>)</p>
