    <p style="display: inline;font-size:50px;">; nothing friendly that might warm ('I'm cold, let's go back to Paris). Anxiety mounts; I observe its progress, like Socrates chatting (as I am reading) and feeling the cold</p><p style="display: inline;font-size: 40px;"> and astonished fashion; I am calm, attentive, as if I were confronted by a strange insect of which I am suddenly no longer afraid. Certain parts of the body are particularly appropriate to this observation: eyelashes, nails, roots of the hair, the incomplete</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 30px;">melancholy (and not at all a clinical one), for I accuse myself of nothing, nor am I prostrated. My sadness belongs to that fringe of melancholy where the loss of the loved being remains abstract. A double lack: I cannot even invest my misery, as I could when I suffered from being in love. In those days I desired, dreamed, struggled;</p><p style="display: inline;font-size: 25px;"> so hard all day with the image of the loved being, that I always slept very well at night.” And Werther, shortly before committing suicide,<p style="display: inline;font-size: 20px;"> Werther pays a visit to Charlotte, who asks him not to come and see her again before Christmas day, thereby signifying to him that he must visit less frequently and that henceforth his passion will no longer be “received”: there follows a scene. The scene slarts with a disagreement: Charlotte is embarrassed, <p style="display: inline;font-size: 17px;">various trivial subjects of conversation are launched, all of which fall flat. The situation is charged. With what? With the fact that each person is perceived by the other two in his role (of husband, of lover, of stake), without its being possible to take account of this role in the conversation. What is heavy is the silent knowledge: I know that you know that I know: this is the general formula</p>

    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 13px;">corresponds to no ritual; the situations in which I say I-love-you cannot be classified: I love-you is irrepressible and unforeseeable Then to what linguistic order does this odd being, this linguistic feint, belong, too articulated to be no more than an impulse, too phatic to be a sentence? It is neither quite what is uttered (no message is congealed, sorted, mummified within it, ready for dissection) nor quite the uttering itself (the subject does not allow himself to be intimidated by the play of interlocutory sites). We might call it a proffering, which has no scientific place: I-love-you belongs neither in the realm of linguistics nor in that of semiology. Its occasion (the point of departure for speaking it) would be, rather, Music.</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 17px;"> of embarrassment, a frozen, white modesty which takes the insignificance (of remarks) as its insignia.</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 20px;">Werther is excited, and Charlotte’s embarrassment excites Werther all the more: thus the scene has only one subject, divided by a differential of energy (the scene is electric).</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 25px;"> goes to bed and sleeps very soundly. Modes of waking: sad, wracked (with tenderness), affectless, innocent, panic-stricken (Octave comes to, after fainting: “All of a sudden his miseries were clear in his mind: one does not die of pain, or he was a dead man at that moment”).</p>
     <p style="display: inline;font-size: 30px;"> the benefit lay before me, merely delayed, traversed by contretemps. Now, no more resonance. Everything is calm, and that is worse. Though justified by an economy—the image dies so that I may live—amorous mourning always has something left over: one expression keeps recurring: “What a shame!”</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size: 40px;"> objects.</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size:50px;">of the hemlock rising in his body; I hear it identify itself moving up, like an inexorable figure, against the background of the things that are here.</p>
    <p style="display: inline;font-size:60px;">is to be surprised. The lover is constantly so; he has no time to transform, to reverse, to protect. Perhaps he knows his stupidity, but he does not censure it. Or again: his stupidity acts as a cleavage, a perversion: <i>it's stupid, he says, and yet . . . it’s true.</i>)</p>
